# Demo.Framework
Tequipment Test Case

For this task, I created an automation framework from scratch by using Selenium, NUnit and c#. For logging and reporting, I used extent reports. An HTML report is generated at the end of test execution, which can be accessed at  C:\Users\{user}\source\repos\Demo.Framework\Demo.Framework\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\Report. The test case takes two screenshots: First, the screenshot of the modal that appears after clicking on "Add to Cart" button. Second, the screenshot of the final confirmation page. Screenshots are attached to the extent report.
